<h3>Your Order Status Has Been Updated!</h3>
<p>Hi {{ user.name }},</p>
<p>This is a quick update to let you know that the status of your order (<strong>#{{ order.id }}</strong>) has been changed to:</p>
<h2 style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f0f2f5; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">
    {{ order.status }}
</h2>
{% if order.status == 'Shipped' %}
<p>Your items are on their way!</p>
{% endif %}
<p>You can view your order history on your dashboard at any time.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>The AgriConnect Team</p>
